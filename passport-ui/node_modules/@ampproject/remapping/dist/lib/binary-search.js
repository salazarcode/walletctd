/**
 * A binary search implementation that returns the index if a match is found,
 * or the negated index of where the `needle` should be inserted.
 *
 * The `comparator` callback receives both the `item` under comparison and the
 * needle we are searching for. It must return `0` if the `item` is a match,
 * any negative number if `item` is too small (and we must search after it), or
 * any positive number if the `item` is too large (and we must search before
 * it).
 *
 * If no match is found, a negated index of where to insert the `needle` is
 * returned. This negated index is guaranteed to be less than 0. To insert an
 * item, negate it (again) and splice:
 *
 * ```js
 * const array = [1, 3];
 * const needle = 2;
 * const index = binarySearch(array, needle, (item, needle) => item - needle);
 *
 * assert.equal(index, -2);
 * assert.equal(~index, 1);
 * array.splice(~index, 0, needle);
 * assert.deepEqual(array, [1, 2, 3]);
 * ```
